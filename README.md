# Text-Based-RPG-Java
one of my first programming projects I made in Java.
Its a text based role playing game where you choose your class and fight your way through an endless dungeon fighting monsters
The game uses the Dungeon & Dragons battle rules to calculate the hit, misses, and damages. 
The idea came to me after play a few sessions of Dungeons & Dragons and I wanted to make a single player version of it.
